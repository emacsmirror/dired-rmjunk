;;; Commentary:

;; dired-rmshit is a port of Jakub Klinkovský's rmshit.py to Dired. The
;; interactive function, `dired-rmshit' will mark all files in the
;; current Dired buffer that match one of the patterns specified in
;; `dired-rmshit-shitty-files'. The tool is intended as a simple means
;; for keeping one's home directory tidy -- removing "junk" dotfiles.

;; The original implementation of rmshit.py can be found at:
;; <https://github.com/lahwaacz/Scripts/blob/master/rmshit.py>
