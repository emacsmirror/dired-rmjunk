# dired-rmshit

dired-rmshit is a port of Jakub Klinkovsk√Ω's rmshit.py to Dired. The interactive
function, `dired-rmshit` will mark all files in the current Dired buffer that
match one of the patterns specified in `dired-rmshit-shitty-files`. The tool is
intended as a simple means for keeping one's home directory tidy -- removing
"junk" dotfiles.

The original implementation of rmshit.py can be found at:
